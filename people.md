### PhD Students

**[Perry Gibson](https://gibsonic.org) (Oct 2019 ‚Äî Present)** <br>  <img src="/assets/img/people/pg_profile.jpg" width="100px" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
Across the machine learning stack, my view is that increasingly the centre is the tensor compiler: bridging the knowledge gap between models and hardware.
