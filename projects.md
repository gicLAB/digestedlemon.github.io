## Past Projects

### BonsAPPs AIMDDE

The Glasgow Intelligent Computing Lab (gicLAB) was awarded funding to undertaking the AIMDDE (AI-based Manufacturing Defect Detection at the Edge) research challenge, in response to the Open Call for AI Talents of the BonsAPPs Horizon 2020 project.
We succesfully met all of the goals of the challenge, was were able to adapt the work into [a paper at AccML 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09359).
Please [see our blogpost](../2022-01-25-aimdde_announce/), and <https://bonsapps.eu/> for details.
